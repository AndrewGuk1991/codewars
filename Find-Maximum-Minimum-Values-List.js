// Description:

// Your task is to make two functions ( max and min, or maximum and minimum, etc., depending on the language ) that receive a list of integers as input, and return the largest and lowest number in that list, respectively.

// Solution:

var min = function(list){
    
    return Math.min.apply(null, list);
}


var max = function(list){
    
    return Math.max.apply(null, list);
}
